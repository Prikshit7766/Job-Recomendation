To assist job seekers, the process begins with uploading their CV to TalentHive. The CV is then processed by Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology and undergoes Natural Language Processing (NLP). The NLP process compares the uploaded CV with various job postings to determine the best match based on similarity. Finally, the system provides a list of recommended jobs that match the user's qualifications and experience.

For recruiters, the process begins with inputting the job post into TalentHive. The job post undergoes NLP analysis alongside the CVs in the database. Using various comparison methods, TalentHive identifies the best-matching candidates for the job posting. The system then provides a list of recommended candidates to the recruiter based on their qualifications and experience.

With web scraping restricted on job search engines like Indeed, we turned to Apify to collect relevant job-related data. Utilizing Apify's advanced tools and automation capabilities, we were able to efficiently and accurately extract large volumes of data. This enabled us to provide up-to-date and precise job postings and candidate recommendations to job seekers and recruiters.

<h1 align="center">MongoDB</h1>

We are retrieving  data from a MongoDB database job recommendation, which is comprised of three distinct collections: Resume_Data, all_locations_Data, and preprocessed_jobs_Data whhere as there are two more collection inside the same database which are Resume_from_CANDIDATE and Resume_from_RESUME_ANALYZER in order to store resumes entered by users on the job recommendation and resume analyzer pages. These collections will serve as a repository for user-provided resumes, allowing for more personalized and accurate job recommendations and analysis.

By utilizing Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology, we were able to convert a PDF document containing textual data into a machine-encoded text format that can be further processed and analyzed in a Jupyter Notebook. OCR is an advanced technology that enables the automatic conversion of scanned documents and images into machine-encoded text that can be easily manipulated and analyzed. By leveraging OCR technology, we were able to extract valuable insights from the textual data, enabling us to gain a deeper understanding of the information contained within the document.

<h1 align="center">Natural Language Processing</h1>
Data preprocessing is an essential step in building a Machine Learning model and depending on how well the data has been preprocessed; the results are seen.

In NLP, text preprocessing is the first step in the process of building a model.

Some text preprocessing steps used are:
