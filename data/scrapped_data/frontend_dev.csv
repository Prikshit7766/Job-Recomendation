"illuminator Technologies Pvt Ltd",,"Full Stack Developers are developers that design complete apps and websites. These developers work on all facets of development, from frontend to backend, to database, and even debugging and testing. In short, the developer must understand the app through and through.

They can handle all aspects of development, and it can result in a more seamlessly created product.However, resources to become a Full Stack Developer are limited and only offer sections or just random technologies that you must learn and combine on your own. So, we introduced this course that compiles all technologies in perfect sync to help developers transition from simple developer to become Full Stack Developer.Starting from frontend development, the learner will slowly progress to become to other aspects of development including backend, database, debugging, version control, and other essential technologies that are helpful for a developer.Our Full Stack Course breaks down the fundamentals of each technology that you would require to become a Full Stack Developer. The entire course is broken down into five separate segments: Frontend, Backend, Database, Other Essential Technologies, and Debugging/Version Control. Each section includes multiple technologies to help you gain more experience as a developer.That’s not it! In addition to theory-based learning, the course also focuses on practical applications by covering multiple projects in great detail, helping you learn with hands-on experience.Let’s look at the different technologies and frameworks that you will learn:Frontend – HTML, HMTL5, CSS3, Twitter Bootstrap, JavaScript, jQueryBackend – Node.js, Meteor.js, Angular 2, PHP, Ruby on RailsDatabase – MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, CouchDB, Apache CassandraOther Essential Technologies – Memcached, Redis, Apache Lucene, Apache SolrDebugging/Version Control – GIT, Subversion, Task Runners (Grunt, Gulp), Debuggers (Xdebug, Firebug)Each technology will include functional projects that you will create with the help of the instructor.

  Role : Software Engineer (Front end)
   
   Who we are
   
   Maersk is well established as the world’s largest operator of container shipping and marine container terminals, with over 80,000 employees and operating in 130 countries worldwide.
 
 
 
   We are rapidly transforming ourselves into the world’s leading global integrator of container logistics by building on our traditional strengths and creating synergies and simplifying global supply chains for our customers across ocean, terminals and logistics & services.
 
 
 
   Technology and data are critical enablers of this digital transformation, as we seek to digitally enable and connect our physical supply chain assets in our terminals, our vessel fleet and inland logistics services through an ambitious agenda of standardisation, automation and IoT enablement.
 
 
 
   In support of this strategy, we have recently restructured our global technology organisation to be based around a joint business and technology platform operating model, which embeds innovative, agile, digital and data product engineering at the heart of our business.
 
 
 
   APM Terminals
 
 
 
   The Maersk group operates one of the most comprehensive marine container terminals networks in the world, under the brand of APM Terminals, with over 20,000 employees operating 76 terminals in 36 countries and growing.
 
 
 
   APM Terminals (APMT) plays a critical role in enabling the global Maersk Ocean and Logistics network as well as serving other Shipping Lines, Beneficial Cargo Owners, Freight Forwarders, intermodal logistics providers and integrating with a wide variety of local port authorities, customs and government bodies across our global network of transhipment, import and export gateway terminals.
 
 
 
   In support of the broader Maersk strategy, we are accelerating the transformation of our business from a portfolio of independently operated terminals, into a safer, better, bigger global terminals operator.
 
 
 
   This transformation is enabled by an ambitious programme to modernise our technology landscape, digitise our operations and our customers’ experience and optimise our end-to-end operations and customers’ journeys through automation, digitised assets and data analytics.
 
 
 
   In support of this strategy, we are implementing a new technology organisation across APMT that will accelerate this journey by strengthening our internal engineering and data analytics capabilities and further embed an agile DevSecOPS operating model at scale.
 
 
 
   APMT - Customer Products & Services Platform Portfolio
 
 
 
   As part of this new technology organisation a new global Customer Products & Services platform portfolio team has been created with a variety of roles being recruited across architecture, design, full stack DevSecOPS engineering and agile delivery at scale.
 
 
 
   The Customer Products & Services platform portfolio team has end-to-end accountability for all data and technology enabled customer outcomes and enabling commercial capabilities across the APM Terminals business.
 
 
 
   This directly supports APM Terminals ambitious growth strategy built on a customer-centric focus which will deliver industry leading customer care, commercial excellence, and added-value products & services that help our customers optimize their own supply chains.
 
 
 
   This is enabled by an integrated portfolio of platforms and products across digital customer channels, gate solutions, data products & services, customer self-service, sales, marketing, customer care, contract management, pricing, order to cash, customer master data management and 360 view of customer analytics.
   
   What We Offer
 
 
   This position offers a unique opportunity to develop and apply your cutting-edge knowledge and passion of software engineering, data and data science that will transform the transport and logistics industry.
 
 
   We operate in a fast-paced environment utilizing modern technologies and bias toward action.

   This is an extremely exciting time to join a dynamic team and solve some of the toughest problems in the industry and build the future of trade & logistics. We focus on our people and the right candidate will have broad possibilities to further develop competencies in an environment characterized by change and continuous progress.
 
 
   About the Role:
 
 
   We are strengthening APMT’s software development organisation, focusing on driving ownership, predictability, and agility in our technology. We are hiring Front-end Engineers with JavaScript skills working as a key member of our agile teams.
 
 
   In this role, you will have long-term ownership of one or more applications covering build, test, transition, and operation for APMT’s customer-facing systems.
 
 
   Do you want to be supported in your development as a senior engineer? You will work alongside other developers, mentoring them and learning from them and from the wider APMT technology teams around the world. We pride ourselves on our brands and identity that builds on our heritage. This role is an opportunity to be part of APMT digital evolution.
 
 
   Your considerable skills will be applied to applications built in modern SPAs built in VueJS, backed by micro-service APIs.

   In support of this strategy, we have recently restructured our global technology organisation to be based around a joint business and technology platform operating model, which embeds innovative, agile, digital and data product engineering at the heart of our business.
 
 
 
   APM Terminals
 
 
 
   The Maersk group operates one of the most comprehensive marine container terminals networks in the world, under the brand of APM Terminals, with over 20,000 employees operating 76 terminals in 36 countries and growing.
 
 
 
   APM Terminals (APMT) plays a critical role in enabling the global Maersk Ocean and Logistics network as well as serving other Shipping Lines, Beneficial Cargo Owners, Freight Forwarders, intermodal logistics providers and integrating with a wide variety of local port authorities, customs and government bodies across our global network of transhipment, import and export gateway terminals.
 
 
 
   In support of the broader Maersk strategy, we are accelerating the transformation of our business from a portfolio of independently operated terminals, into a safer, better, bigger global terminals operator.
 
 
 
   This transformation is enabled by an ambitious programme to modernise our technology landscape, digitise our operations and our customers’ experience and optimise our end-to-end operations and customers’ journeys through automation, digitised assets and data analytics.
 
 
 
   In support of this strategy, we are implementing a new technology organisation across APMT that will accelerate this journey by strengthening our internal engineering and data analytics capabilities and further embed an agile DevSecOPS operating model at scale.
 
 
 
   APMT - Customer Products & Services Platform Portfolio
 
 
 
   As part of this new technology organisation a new global Customer Products & Services platform portfolio team has been created with a variety of roles being recruited across architecture, design, full stack DevSecOPS engineering and agile delivery at scale.
 
 
 
   The Customer Products & Services platform portfolio team has end-to-end accountability for all data and technology enabled customer outcomes and enabling commercial capabilities across the APM Terminals business.
 
 
 
   This directly supports APM Terminals ambitious growth strategy built on a customer-centric focus which will deliver industry leading customer care, commercial excellence, and added-value products & services that help our customers optimize their own supply chains.
 
 
 
   This is enabled by an integrated portfolio of platforms and products across digital customer channels, gate solutions, data products & services, customer self-service, sales, marketing, customer care, contract management, pricing, order to cash, customer master data management and 360 view of customer analytics.
