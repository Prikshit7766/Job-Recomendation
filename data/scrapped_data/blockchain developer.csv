   #WeAreCisco,
 
 
   where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it. We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box! But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.) Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward. So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!

     We Are Cisco
     #WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.
     We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!
     But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it).
     Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.
     
     So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool.

       About Us
        We are a Product Engineering company. We specialize in building innovative products from ideation to development. We are not a typical IT services company and don’t do support and maintenance projects! Founded by an ex-Googler (or Xoogler) in 2009, we have created a niche for ourselves by leveraging the most exciting technologies in AI/ML, Cloud, DevOps, IIoT, and more. Our people have a fantastic time upskilling and working on them.
        We have an enviable list of customers, including Facebook, Oracle, Siemens, Roche, Medtronics, and several exciting startups. Our projects are typically innovation-driven. For instance, we are building an AI platform to personalize cancer treatment by analyzing genealogy data. Work can’t get more impactful than this! 
      
     
    
   
   
   
    
     
      
       We have a 4.7 rating on Glassdoor!
        What’s more, did you know that we have spun off several exciting product AI and RPA companies like PipeCandy and element5? Our spin-offs operate from the same office and present unique opportunities to the challenge-hungry. So when you join Ideas2IT, you actually open up a whole new world of possibilities! 
      
     
    
   
  
 
 
 
  
   
    
     
      
       Job description 
        Would you like to work for top clients like Facebook, Microsoft, and innovative Silicon Valley startups? Build products instead of back-office applications? 
        Would you like to work on projects which are truly Cloud Native? Want to get your hands’ dirty tuning performance of internet-scale applications? Tackle challenging tasks like implementing a tamper-proof audit trail with AOP and Blockchain? Discover the best turn in your Java Development career here.
        
        
        About Ideas2IT 
        Ideas2IT is a product engineering firm where Technology, Business, and Product engineering intersect. We possess deep expertise in building consumer and SaaS products. We deliver innovative solutions that involve developing cloud-native, scalable, data-driven applications. We take up the development of cognitive applications that leverage Machine Learning and NLP. 
        We have clocked phenomenal growth in the last ten years and are marching towards lofty goals. Ideas2IT has successfully rolled out multiple products like Pipecandy, that have become successful VC-funded startups. 
        Our casual work culture, flexible work hours, flat organization structure, and non-Bell Curve appraisals are just a few factors that have led to our 4.5 Glassdoor rating.
        
        
        About the role 
        The Java Developer role entails creating high-performance and reusable components like core application logic, databases, data and application integration, API, and other backend processes to drive our clients’ innovation-led applications. This is not yet another Java Developer role where you just create layers of interconnected classes with Java syntax. We need people with a deep understanding of building complex microservices on the cloud leveraging the power of Java and associated technologies.
        
        
        What’s in it for you?

        Large scale Cloud-Native applications 
        Document Comprehension Engine leveraging RNN and other latest OCR techniques 
        Completely data-driven low-code platform 
        You will leverage cutting-edge technologies like Blockchain, IoT, and Data Science as you work on projects for leading Silicon Valley startups. 
        Your role does not start or end with just Java development; you will enjoy the freedom to share your suggestions on the choice of tech stacks across the length of the project 
        If there is a certain technology you would like to explore, you can do your Technical PoCs 
        Work in a culture that values capability over experience and continuous learning as a core tenet
       
        
        
        Job requirements 
        Here’s what you’ll bring

        Deep insights into behavioral criteria like transaction and memory management 
        Ability to write high-quality code with test-driven development 
        Strong familiarity in a database like MySQL, Postgres, Oracle, Mongo, etc.

        Familiarity with modern design principles like Microservices and Native Cloud components 
        
       If you have the relevant experience, great! Otherwise, it isn’t all that matters. We believe in hiring people for their IQ and the right attitude, over ready-made skills. 
        As long as you are passionate about building world-class enterprise-grade products, and have an in-depth understanding of your technology – we will bring you to speed on all the tech stacks we use. Oh BTW, did we mention that you need to be super smart?
        
        
      
     
    
   
  
 
 
  
   
    
     
      
       Why work at Ideas2IT 
      
     
     
     
      
       
        
         
          
           Startup Of Startups  
          
         
         
          
           We build multiple products ourselves, hence you will have broad exposure and all the excitement and learnings that come with working for startups. But since we have large enterprises like Ericsson, Medtronics, and Oracle as anchor customers, we are very stable. Its all the excitement of startups without the associated risk.

           We invest heavily in our employees learning at an accelerated pace. In addition to cutting edge technologies, we create opportunities to learn leadership, entrepreneurship and so on. We have many programs likes Shart Tank, Tech talks, learning groups to make this happen. You can also take initiatives and bring in new technologies. 
          
         
        
       
       
       
        
         
          
           Culture 
          
         
         
          
           We have a unique culture with a lot of individual freedom and responsibility. Many decisions that managers will make in other companies are done by adhoc employee committees. There is a reason people have been with us since founding 10 years ago!

  What is Polygon?
 
 
 
   Polygon is the leading blockchain development platform, offering scalable, affordable, secure and sustainable blockchains for Web3. Its growing suite of products offers developers easy access to major scaling solutions including L2 (ZK Rollups and Optimistic Rollups), sidechains, hybrid, stand-alone and enterprise chains, and data availability. Polygon’s scaling solutions have seen widespread adoption with tens of thousands of decentralized applications hosted, 1.6B+ total transactions processed, 180M+ unique user addresses, and $7B+ in assets secured. Polygon is carbon neutral with the goal of leading the Web3 ecosystem in becoming carbon negative.
 
 
 
   What does the zkEVM Team do?
 
 
 
   Polygon zkEVM is the first zero-knowledge (ZK) scaling solution that’s fully compatible with Ethereum: all existing smart contracts, developer tools, and wallets work seamlessly. The zkEVM harnesses the power of ZK proofs to reduce transaction cost and massively increase throughput, all while inheriting the security of Ethereum L1.
 
 
 
   Job Summary
 
 
 
   We're looking for a 
  Senior Golang Developer to join the Backend team of zkEVM and help develop the node that will be operating the EVM zkRollup. Your task scope will include implementing Merkletrees, Ethereum interfaces (read/write smart contracts), EVM logic, as well as more “traditional” backend features such as APIs, DBs, etc. In addition, you will collaborate with team members in making architectural decisions, choosing best practices, and bringing in new ideas. This is an exciting opportunity to take an active part in the blockchain space and contribute to the decentralization of the future.

        We are a Product Engineering company. We specialize in building innovative products from ideation to development. We are not a typical IT services company and don’t do support and maintenance projects! Founded by an ex-Googler (or Xoogler) in 2009, we have created a niche for ourselves by leveraging the most exciting technologies in AI/ML, Cloud, DevOps, IIoT, and more. Our people have a fantastic time upskilling and working on them.
        We have an enviable list of customers, including Facebook, Oracle, Siemens, Roche, Medtronics, and several exciting startups. Our projects are typically innovation-driven. For instance, we are building an AI platform to personalize cancer treatment by analyzing genealogy data. Work can’t get more impactful than this! 
      
     
    
   
   
   
    
     
      
       We have a 4.7 rating on Glassdoor!
        What’s more, did you know that we have spun off several exciting product AI and RPA companies like PipeCandy and element5? Our spin-offs operate from the same office and present unique opportunities to the challenge-hungry. So when you join Ideas2IT, you actually open up a whole new world of possibilities!

        Ideas2IT is a high-end product firm. Started by an ex-Googler, we count Facebook, 
        Siemens, Motorola, eBay, Microsoft, and Zynga among our clients. We solve some very interesting problems in the USA startup ecosystem and have created great products in the process. When we build, we build great! 
        We invest in bleeding-edge technologies like AI, Blockchain, IoT, and complex cloud to leverage technology to build better products for our clients and end-users. 
        We have clocked phenomenal growth in the last ten years and are marching towards lofty goals. Ideas2IT has successfully rolled out multiple products like Pipecandy, (raised $1.1M in seed funding) and element5 (closed a recent funding round successfully with oversubscription a few months ago).
        
        
        About the role 
        Your primary focus will be development of iOS applications and their integration with back-end services.

          A real-time stream processing to real-time sync transactional and analytical databases at scale 
          A data platform that enables AI use cases like advanced semantic text retrieval from product documentation for a German Manufacturing major 
         
        Experience a culture that values capability over experience and continuous learning as a core tenet 
        Bring your ideas to the table and make a significant difference to the success of the product instead of being a small cog in a big wheel.
       
        
        
        What you will be doing here 
       
        Design and build applications for the IOS platform

       About Us
        We are a Product Engineering company. We specialize in building innovative products from ideation to development. We are not a typical IT services company and don’t do support and maintenance projects!

Our people have a fantastic time upskilling and working on them.
        We have an enviable list of customers, including Facebook, Oracle, Siemens, Roche, Medtronics, and several exciting startups. Our projects are typically innovation-driven.
