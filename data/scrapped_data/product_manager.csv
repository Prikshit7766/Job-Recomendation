 Do you want to make a real difference – for Danske Bank, our customers and the society in general? Are you enthusiastic about making the fight against financial crime transparent and form a solid basis for decision making? And do you want to work with cutting edge technology? Well, then this opportunity is the right one for you! 
 Monitoring & Screening Tribe is accountable for enabling real-time screening and retrospective monitoring of customers, transactions and trade flows to fight financial crime. We support the entire Group and play a central role in Danske Banks financial crime prevention within Anti Money Laundering, Counter terrorist financing, Sanctions risk mitigation, Tax Evasion and Fraud prevention. We are approx. 200 engaged colleagues located in three different countries, and we are now looking for a Product Owner to join the tribe and drive our Management Information Reporting Squad. 
 
 Functional leadership – motivate the team and projects 
 As our new Product Owner for Management Information Reporting, you will have the responsibility to create transparent reporting solutions in monitoring and investigations solutions that uses the latest technology within data and analytics domain. Having a good business understanding is key and balancing that with being tech savy will be great assets while navigating a complex stakeholder landscape. 
 As Product Owner, you will drive and prioritize the Squad Product Backlog through being in close dialogue with stakeholders to understand issues and needs, while you create vision and outcomes to support staying ahead of financial crime in the future. 
 You will not only be accountable for the delivery of the product - you will have the full end-to-end responsibility including e.g. owning your solutions, maintenance etc.. You will direct and guide your Squad to deliver on the Backlog – though you will not have HR responsibilities. 
 “The squad is cross functional, with squad members from different backgrounds and nationalities. The Product Owner needs to be a great functional leader that can motivate the team and make sure we deliver” says Anders, who will be your future manager. 
 
 Understand the customers and fight financial crime 
 A typical day would involve engaging with key business owners to establish a trustful collaboration and understand reporting needs. It also involves spending time with your Squad where you share your vision and strategy for what needs to be built in order to succeed your key deliveries. 
 You love building interpersonal relationships and thrive in open collaboration and communication and believe this is superior to working in silos. You have an ability to set direction for your Squad and at the same time have a desire to engage in discussions on how solutions are developed to support the outcome you see is needed. Structure, planning and value-driven prioritisation is natural to you and Agile development experience is an advantage but not a must. 
 You will be leading a Squad of both technical and non-technical individuals, so being able to bridge the gap and solve business needs with IT solutions needs some technical interest and flair, but you don’t need to have a technical background. 
 Being responsible for delivering reporting solutions for our entire area, you still be working on a varying set of domains, so a desire and ability to learn new processes is key and business intelligence experience is a plus (we use Tableau for some of our solutions). 
 “You will have the opportunity to help Danske Bank fight financial crime and ensure that our customers are safe – and if this is something that motivates you, this is the right position!” says Anders, “and I look forward to hear from you”.

 About The Position 
 
  WebCargo digitizes global freight sales for over 2,000 of the world’s largest logistics providers and carriers. Or, in plain English, we help move the world, offering incredible technology that powers almost a third of the global air cargo market.
   We’re not alone either. WebCargo is a proud part of the Freightos Group, a logistics technology company that aims to make global trade frictionless. That’s not cheap, so we’ve raised nearly $100 million from investors like GE Ventures, the Singapore Exchange and Aleph, making and have gotten the BBC, TechCrunch, and the Wall Street Journal excited about freight.
   Turns out it’s kind of a big deal. As one of the largest tech platforms for a huge industry (the phone or computer you’re reading this on was, after all shipped), we’ve been crushing it with double-digit growth, year after year.
   Are you passionate about finding errors for insane edge cases and love a wide variety of challenges? Do you have a passion for using tools, technology, and heck, even your mother’s critical eye to solve problems? Do you want to join a startup that’s changing how everything in the world gets from A to B? Do you value delivering highly scalable and the highest quality software? When details are ignored, containers fall off of ships. And that’s a big deal.
   Good news, friend. We got something incredible for you.
   WebCargo is looking for a QA Engineer who supports everyone to develop high-quality software. The perfect engineer lives and breathes classic Agile techniques that ensure quality code is released to production at the end of a sprint. Quality is a way of life for you; you’ll be parachuted into a development team to act as a quality advocate, helping team members on making rock-solid, scalable developments. How? By designing, creating, and implementing test cases and quality requirements, as well as automating manual processes and functional testing. As Kanye West would say if he was looking for a QA engineer, we’re looking for motivation to automation, to win the races to edge cases.
  
   Responsibilities
  
    Preach quality. Beyond testing, you'll support everyone to develop high-quality software, with automated and manual testing as your sword and shield.
    Get ready to coordinate. You’ll guide releases through test planning, preparation, design, and execution tasks. And you’ll love doing it.
    Things don’t work without a framework. Along with your QA colleagues, you’ll design, develop and upkeep a test framework for automating tests, creating the right infrastructure for the R&D organization;

Visit www.worldbank.org. 
 ITS Vice Presidency Context: 
 Information and Technology Solutions (ITS) enables the WBG to achieve its mission of ending extreme poverty and promote shared prosperity in a sustainable way by delivering transformative information and technologies to its staff working in over 150 locations. 
 Our vision is to transform how the Bank Group accomplishes its mission through information and technology. In this fast-paced, ever-changing world, the formulation and implementation of the ITS strategy is an ongoing, iterative process of learning and adaptation developed through extensive consultations with business partners throughout the World Bank Group. 
 ITS shapes its strategy in response to changing business priorities and leverages new technologies to achieve three high-level business outcomes: business enablement, by providing Bank Group units with innovative digital tools and technologies to transform how they deliver value for their clients; empowerment & effectiveness, by ensuring that all Bank Group staff are connected, able to find information, and productive to accelerate the delivery of development solutions globally; and resilience, by equipping the Bank Group to provide risk-based cybersecurity and robust data protection for a global network and a growing cloud platform. 
 Implementation of the strategy is guided by three core principles. The first is to deliver solutions for business partners that are customer-centric, innovative, and transformative. The second is to provide the Bank Group with value for money with selective and standard technologies. The third principle is to excel at the basics by providing a high performing, robust, and resilient IT environment for the organization.

  Do you want to build a career that is truly worthwhile? Working at the World Bank provides a unique opportunity for you to help our clients solve their greatest development challenges.

Visit www.worldbank.org. 
 ITS Vice Presidency Context: 
 Information and Technology Solutions (ITS) enables the WBG to achieve its mission of ending extreme poverty and promote shared prosperity in a sustainable way by delivering transformative information and technologies to its staff working in over 150 locations. 
 Our vision is to transform how the Bank Group accomplishes its mission through information and technology. In this fast-paced, ever-changing world, the formulation and implementation of the ITS strategy is an ongoing, iterative process of learning and adaptation developed through extensive consultations with business partners throughout the World Bank Group. 
 ITS shapes its strategy in response to changing business priorities and leverages new technologies to achieve three high-level business outcomes: business enablement, by providing Bank Group units with innovative digital tools and technologies to transform how they deliver value for their clients; empowerment & effectiveness, by ensuring that all Bank Group staff are connected, able to find information, and productive to accelerate the delivery of development solutions globally; and resilience, by equipping the Bank Group to provide risk-based cybersecurity and robust data protection for a global network and a growing cloud platform. 
 Implementation of the strategy is guided by three core principles. The first is to deliver solutions for business partners that are customer-centric, innovative, and transformative. The second is to provide the Bank Group with value for money with selective and standard technologies. The third principle is to excel at the basics by providing a high performing, robust, and resilient IT environment for the organization. 
 The ITSGC department is part of ITS and provides global communications capabilities, client services and products, and support for all member organizations across the World Bank Group. The services for which ITSGC is responsible are delivered by 5 different units: ITSNI (Global Network Management), ITSCU (Unified Communications, Telephony, and Videoconferencing), ITSEW (End-User and Workplace Computing), ITSCS (Helpdesk, front-line IT support, and IT training), and ITSRD (Rapid Application Development). Additionally, ITSGC is also responsible for the coordination and implementation of all infrastructure projects facing WBG country offices.
