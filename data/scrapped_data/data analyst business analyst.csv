  BUK & BX – All locations 
 We are currently in the early stages of implementing a hybrid working environment, which means that many colleagues spend part of their working hours at home and part in the office, depending on the nature of the role they are in. We’re flexible on how this works and it may continue to change and evolve. Depending on your team, typically this means that colleagues spend a minimum of between 20% to 60% of their time in the office, which could be over a week, a month or a quarter. However, some colleagues may choose to spend more time in the office over a typical period than their role type requires. We also have a flexible working process where, subject to business needs, all colleagues globally are able to request work patterns to reflect their personal circumstances These requests will be reviewed and agreed for a period of time i.e., will have a start and end date. Please discuss the detail of the working pattern options for the role with the hiring manager.

 The team…
  The Chief Operating Office of Global Finance is responsible for the design and implementation of risk and control frameworks that span the Finance function globally. The Finance Issue Management team sits within the newly created Finance Risk and Control function alongside other key teams such as Model Strategy, Operational Risk, Compliance Transformation, Finance PMO Governance and EUC Management.
  The role…
  The Issue Management Reporting Analyst will be part of a reporting team which will have responsibility for developing, producing, and automating where possible, reporting of issue related information across Finance. Issues include those raised by Internal Audit, External Regulatory Agencies, Internal 2nd line of defense or self-identified by the Finance function. The reporting has different use cases
  1) Management reporting – to support Finance Executive Management and teams with quantitative and qualitative insight as to the status and trajectory of issues under their responsibility. This will be used for management forums such as Business Risk and Control Committees (BRCCs), Issues Oversight forums, Performance assessments or other day to day management activities. Qualitative aspects of this reporting require engagement with multiple issues owners and coordinating and validating commentary and status updates.
  2) Operational reporting – to support Finance Issue Management in its role of monitoring and managing adherence to policies and procedures. This will include weekly reporting of changes in issue status, monitoring adherence to data quality reviews and standards, optimizing scheduling of issues for Quality Assurance reviews, amongst others.
  3) Analytics – to produce ad hoc analytics and deep dives beyond the requirements of BAU Management or Operational reporting. This will involve working with a richer / broader set of data to deepen analysis, while also ensuring the insight generated is clearly articulated. This may range from assessing cross firm dependencies for complex issues or assessing issue root causes to identify trends / patterns or leveraging planned remediation timelines to assess capacity planning initiatives.
  In each of the areas above, for reports which reach a pattern of matured repeatability, the team will drive requirements gathering and documentation to partner with the Digital solutions team to identify and drive automation opportunities.
  The candidate…
  The ideal candidate will demonstrate strong and disciplined data management and quantitative analytical skills. This may have been developed through a financial, data, consulting, or other related role. Ability to design and manage key reports is critical, ideally familiarity with dashboard tools, automation in excel or other means will be important. Qualitatively, an understanding of issues related data, either from a risk, audit or similar background would be helpful. Critically, this role requires a strong attention to detail, deep curiosity to look beyond the numbers, and the ability to explain reports / insights in an accessible manner to different audiences. This is not a check the box reporting role – a successful analysts will go beyond the technical requirements to understand the substance of the data at hand – this will require engagement with issue owners, partners, or other stakeholders to truly effective.
  The opportunity…!
  This is an exciting opportunity for a highly motivated and experienced analyst to get exposure to a wide range of control issues and their remediation, across multiple finance processes and varying levels of complexity. This is a new team and process offering that unique opportunity to craft the role with your personality!
