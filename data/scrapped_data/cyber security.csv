  Why Cisco
  
 
  #WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all.
  
 
  We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!
  
 
  But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
  
 
  Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.
  
 
  So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!

 The Role 
 
  Where you fit In?
  
   The Information Risk posture of Shell includes a wide variety of potential business impacts, such as HSSE impacts, production loss, financial and maintenance operations loss, loss of Most Confidential bidding data.
  
   The IRM Function defines requirements for the assessment of Information Risks, defines the selection of mandated IT Controls, and defines and executes assessments of the design and operational effectiveness of these controls. The function organises communication campaigns to impact the behaviour of business and IT staff where it relates to Information Risks.
  
   In addition to these preventative measures, the IRM Function includes a Cyber Resilience function to understand the cyber threat landscape and the vulnerabilities to cyberattacks in IT systems and services, to detect malicious behaviour and to respond to incidents.
  
   Organisationally, the IRM Function reports to the Group CIO. The IRM Function consists of a central team with the Strategy, Learning, Risk and Transformation teams. The IRM Function in the IT Operations Organisation (IDSO) consists of the Detect and Respond Teams and there are business specific teams in each Business and in Global Functions IT.
   Given the Cyber threat landscape and its development, it is critical that the IRM Function collaborates closely with suppliers and industry peers and collaborates effectively with government agencies in key countries that Shell operates in.As businesses leverage digitalization opportunities, their cyber-attack surface structurally increases, which can lead to business disruptions, data breaches and brand damage. High profile industry incidents show that these risks are real, and this has turned cyber resilience into a topic for Boards.
  
   Cyber-attacks can cause damage to reputations, destruction of assets and loss of information. Shell is taking action to detect and respond to the continuous flow of these types of attacks. As part of the Information Risk Management function, the Cyber Defence capability has specific focus on identifying cyber threats, discovery of IT vulnerabilities, monitoring for cyber intrusions and response to security incidents.
  
   What's the role?
  
   As part of the CyberDefence SecOps team member the Vulnerability team has the following main areas of focus:
   Security incident handling and vulnerability management are two key processes within security operations. Both processes have a standard workflow and need to be trackable and measurable and therefore require adequate tool support. The SecOps project aims to implement both processes in ServiceNow Security Operations (SecOps). This will enable the implementation of a standard set of workflows for these process and integration with IT service management processes executed by Line of Defence 1 within IRM, using market standard processes and tools where possible, and simplifying the architecture by reducing the dependency on the use of Collective.
   For this work we are looking for senior advisor who has a sound understanding of the ServiceNow architecture (including interfaces) and modules used in Shell, and the processes that ServiceNow supports. In addition, the candidate needs to have an understanding of IRM processes in general, and Vulnerability and Incident Management processes in particular. Stakeholder management is important in terms of guiding the project to successfully implement these processes in ServiceNow in such a way that full alignment is achieved with the ServiceNow architecture as well as with the Incident and Vulnerability Management teams. Given that both the ServiceNow development team and some of the CyberDefence Incident Management team are in Bangalore, a Bangalore-based member with proven virtual stakeholder management skills - in addition to sound IRM knowledge - is preferred.

    Madness about quality: Put together, individual lines of code should be robust, scalable, high-performance, fault-tolerant, and most importantly, beautiful software. We also stay up-to-date with the latest in the world of software to make ourselves better.
    Passion: To try out new ideas and iterate on existing product features, and love experimenting with new technology if it's right for the job. Because not only do we ride the cutting edge, we make it happen.
    Collaboration: We believe that engineering is a continuous process of learning and improvement and that the best way to learn is by getting help from your fellow engineers. Coding is more fun when you do it together and appreciate the feedback.
