  You are self-motivated, and have demonstrated abilities to think independently as a data scientist
  You structure your data science approach according to the necessary task, while appropriately applying the correct level of model complexity to the problem at hand
  Strong Python skills (some specifics of Sagemaker is a plus), and SQL skills are a must. Experience having deployed models to production is a plus.
  You have an agile mindset of continuous learning and will focus on integrating enterprise value into team culture
  You are kind, collaborative, and capable of seeking and giving candid feedback that effectively contributes to a more seamless day-to-day execution of tasks
  Ability to spin up quick visualization prototypes in PowerBI, Qliksense, or other similar tools is preferred. Experience with R-Shiny, Bokeh, Django, or JavaScript is a plus.
  You have an agile mindset of continuous learning and will focus on integrating enterprise value into team culture

  This role has been designated as ‘Edge’, which means you will primarily work outside of an HPE office.
 
  Job Description:
 
  Data Scientist
  This role has been designated as ‘Edge’ in the HPE terminology, which means you will primarily work outside of an HPE office.
 
  Job Description
 
  The Data Scientist will play a prominent role in working with planning and operations stakeholders of our business unit, to shape the evolution of the systems and processes providing leaders with business-critical data insights.
 
  Specifically, you will collaborate with the reporting team to maintain and evolve the processes feeding our MySQL database, used as repository of both financial and non-financial data, and as source of our key performance indicators. In fact, our numerous processes feeding this database (both automated processes and human-based processes) need to be enhanced to maximize their efficiency, optimizing both their usability and the accuracy and exploitability of the produced data. In parallel, by working with the Database Administrator, we need evolve the internal architecture of the database in the most effective possible way, to allow effective exploitation by its data clients (whether PowerBI, Excel, or any other tool used for our reporting and Business Intelligence).
 
  This role requires architectural understanding, long-term vision, and process optimization skills. At the same time, while these skills will power your creativity to recommend the best long-term solutions, this role requires substantial skills of hands-on development, in order to deliver concrete functional steps towards the gradual implementation of the plan and vision.
 
  Such concrete development can take several forms. In some cases, it will take the form of data manipulations in our database, or across databases: this obviously requires profound data analysis and data engineering skills, including high proficiency with data manipulation and analysis tools (from Excel to PowerBI). In other cases, it will take the form of automating data operations that are repetitive and should not be kept manual: for this reason, software development experience is welcome, particularly in the area of data automation (via combinations of SQL, PHP, ODBC, VBA, PowerQuery, PowerAutomate, PowerBI ETL tools, Python, C#, C++, or any relevant automation language), in collaboration with the subject matter experts on these tools.
 
  You will have the opportunity to work with all levels of the organization, including both executive leaders and technical contributors. This requires both technical and business acumen, and great communication skills. Fluency in English is necessary for effectiveness in these interactions.
 
  We value curiosity and willingness to learn. We are operating in an evolving environment, within a business unit geared for high performance: we look for proactive team players, who are willing to embrace this mindset, and to become a force for adding value by increasing our overall efficiency.
 
  Education And Experience Required
 
 
   Technical/Business related first degree, or equivalent (engineering, business administration, financial auditing, business informatics, mathematics, statistics…).
   Professional experience of owning business intelligence deliverables (reports, dashboards) in a financial reporting environment, or in contributing to automation and software development in a business reporting environment.
 
 
  Knowledge And Skills
 
  Technical skills:
 
   Proficiency with Microsoft Office tools – Excel, Power Query, Power Pivot
   Familiarity with Excel VBA (capability to maintain/modify macros)
   Experience with software development for data automation (see Job Description)
   Familiarity with ODBC and with other methods of data transfer across databases
   Good understanding and practical experience of building SQL queries
   Experience with PHP programming is welcome
 
 
  Non-technical skills:
 
   Structured, articulated, organized mindset
   Strong problem-solving skills, from troubleshooting and debugging to delivering a solution
   Ability to discuss and rationalize requirements (with both technical and non-technical colleagues) and synthesis of their implication towards architectural design choices
   Excellent verbal and written communication skills, including the ability to manage and influence stakeholders
   Good time management skills, and ability to successfully manage multiple parallel deliverables, working within geographically distributed teams and with cross-functional virtual teams
   Willingness to acquire concrete skills in process management, project management, systems management, change management

 Who We Are: 
  Stylumia believes in augmenting human intelligence in fashion and lifestyle retail for a better world. With relevant data and the right technology, people and businesses in fashion and lifestyle retail can solve challenging problems and change the world for the better. In 2015-16, when we looked at the available technology and solutions, we saw fashion forecasting and demand planning are either subjective in nature. We saw these methods do not solve the fundamental challenge in fashion trend spotting, trend forecast, and the business metrics of full-price sell-through continue to remain around the 50% mark creating over USD 750 billion/annum of wastage globally. The biggest wastage in the fashion industry is the one caused by ill-informed decision-making. 
  We saw a need for a different kind of technology and approach, and we knew it would need a different kind of company to build it. That is why we formed Stylumia, a Deep Tech company solving fundamental retail challenges. Stylumia is a global innovation-first Retail AI organisation. We have products that impact the daily lives of varying multi-disciplinary personas across the value chain as we strive to help them eliminate wastage in the industry, by augmenting their decisions with consumer-backed insights.
