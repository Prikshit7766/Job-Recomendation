The approach and tooling being utilised throughout will utilise Agile techniques and has 100% commitment from senior leaders that it will be implemented in the way the Developers see fit rather than some project manager driving this! 
  
  The department has the following set of core values and culture they work towards. 
  
 
  Individual empowerment (reduced hurdles and overhead), quality and continuous improvement built into team's culture 
 
 
  Conscious effort to build a simple architecture and leverage reusable components / services 
 
 
  Targeted use of a cloud based application landscape using 12-factor Application Principles 
 
 
  Team-first attitude along with trust ; support each other to upgrade skills 
 
 
  Standard methodologies with \""minimum requirements\"" clearly articulated 
 
 
  Co-located team with workspace and tools for closer collaboration 
 
 
  Targeted training to impart new tech. skills and methodology knowledge 
 
 
  Strong Tech. leadership that understands the different AD functions, stakeholders and their interests 
 
  If you're a passionate developer and would like to be recognised and rewarded for your development expertise rather than talking a good game then this is the role for you. 
  
  
 Technology & Experience: 
  
  The team is looking for all levels of experience; 
 Asset and Wealth Management banking domain 
 experience is not a pre requisite. 
  
  The attitude and behaviours of the candidate are more important than expertise in a particular library or framework, so if you don't tick all the boxes in the technologies listed but you are 
 passionate about technology, willingness to learn and 
 delivery focused then please feel free to still apply, focused and passionate individuals will get up to speed very quickly on any technology.

  Why Cisco?
  #WeAreCisco. We are all unique, but collectively we bring our talents to work as a team, to develop innovative technology and power a more inclusive, digital future for everyone. How do we do it? Well, for starters – with people like you!
  Nearly every internet connection around the world touches Cisco. We’re the Internet’s optimists. Our technology makes sure the data travelling at light speed across connections does so securely, yet it’s not what we make but what we make happen which marks us out. We’re helping those who work in the health service to connect with patients and each other; schools, colleges and universities to teach in even the most challenging of times. We’re helping businesses of all shapes and size to connect with their employees and customers in new ways, providing people with access to the digital skills they need and connecting the most remote parts of the world – whether through 5G, or otherwise.
  We tackle whatever challenges come our way. We have each other’s backs, we recognise our accomplishments, and we grow together. We celebrate and support one another – from big and small things in life to big career moments. And giving back is in our DNA (we get 10 days off each year to do just that).
  We know that powering an inclusive future starts with us. Because without diversity and a dedication to equality, there is no moving forward. Our 30 Inclusive Communities, that bring people together around commonalities or passions, are leading the way. Together we’re committed to learning, listening, caring for our communities, whilst supporting the most vulnerable with a collective effort to make this world a better place either with technology, or through our actions.
  So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us! #WeAreCisco

  Why Cisco
  #WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all.
  We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we're ""old"" (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we're also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do - you can't put us in a box!
  But ""Digital Transformation"" is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
  Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

  Why Cisco
 
 
   #WeAreCisco, where each person is outstanding, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an expansive future for all.
 
 
   We adopt digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!
 
 
   But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
 
 
   Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.
 
 
   So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!

  #WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all.
  
 
  We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!
 
 
   
 
 
  But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
 
 
   
 
 
  Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

  #WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all.
  
 
  We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!
 
 
   
 
 
  But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
 
 
   
 
 
  Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.
 
 
   
 
 
  So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!
