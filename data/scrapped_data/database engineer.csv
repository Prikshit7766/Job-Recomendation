"Builder.ai - What would you Build?",,"
 About us
  Innovation is fuelled by the power of possibilities. A few years ago, it was virtually impossible to innovate because building software needed a degree, it was simply too expensive, too complex, too risky and ultimately too inefficient. That’s why only 16% of projects were ever done on budget and 78% failed.
  We're changing that. We’re flipping software development on its head and kicking out the notion that you need to be an expert or do boot camps to learn how to make your app. Builder.ai’s platform lets you order the perfect software app for whatever problem you’re trying to solve. Our AI powered assembly line brings together Lego-like reusable features and experts from around the world to bring world-class ideas to life – ANYONE’s world-class ideas.
  Building software needs to be like ordering pizza – pick what you want, get recommendations for the features you need and simply wait till it's cooked and ready for you.
  Our human-assisted AI platform helps anyone build, run & scale tailor-made software. Everyone from the bakery in Riyadh and nursery in London, to large fortune 100 companies like the BBC or Pepsi.
  Life at Builder
  It’s a place where everything moves at lightning pace and most definitely not for the faint hearted. We celebrate diversity, push everyone to do more with less and yet provide a culture that allows everyone to experiment, push boundaries and learn by doing. Every Builder runs to our core value system of HEARTT (Heart, Entrepreneurship, Accountability, Respect, Trust & Transparency) and we’re always looking for team players, with a point of view, a sense of humility and a let’s-get-stuff-done attitude.
  Our scale up is at the intersection of a quirky startup where designers and machine learning specialists work on problems together to savvy commercial teams working with finance folks to invent new business models. #WhatWouldYouBuildWe are looking for a technical leader to help us achieve and maintain maximum potential in areas of rapid software delivery, automation, security, and quality.

  Team Description
  At DataLabs Capital One India, we are at the cutting edge of solving some of the fundamental business problems using advanced data methodologies, statistics and machine learning algorithms.
  In DataLabs Model Risk Management team, we defend the company against model failures and find new ways of making better decisions with models. We use our statistics, software engineering, and business expertise to drive the best outcomes in both Risk Management and the Enterprise. We also understand that we can’t prepare for tomorrow by focusing on today, so we invest in the future: investing in new skills, building better tools, and maintaining a network of trusted partners. We learn from past mistakes and develop increasingly powerful techniques to avoid their repetition.
 
  Role Description
  In this role you will: 
 
  Partner cross-functionally with data scientists, quantitative analysts, business analysts, software engineers, and project managers to manage the risk and uncertainty inherent in statistical and machine learning models in order to lead Capital One to the best decisions, not just avoid the worst ones.
   Build and validate statistical and machine learning models through all phases of development, from design through training, evaluation and implementation
   Develop new ways of identifying weak spots in model predictions earlier and with more confidence than the best available methods
   Assess, challenge, and at times defend state-of-the-art decision-making systems to internal and regulatory partners
   Leverage a broad stack of technologies — Python, R, Conda, AWS, and more — to reveal the insights hidden within huge volumes of data
   Build upon your existing machine learning and statistical toolset - both by learning new technologies and by building custom software tools for data exploration, model performance evaluation, and more
   Communicate technical subject matter clearly and concisely to individuals from various backgrounds both verbally and through written communication; prepare presentations of complex technical concepts and research results to non-specialist audiences and senior management
   Flex your interpersonal skills to translate the complexity of your work into tangible business goals, and challenge model developers to advance their modeling, data, and analytic capabilities
 
  The ideal candidate is:
 
   Inquisitive. You thrive on bringing definition to big, undefined problems. You love asking questions and pushing hard to find answers. You’re not afraid to share a new idea.
   Technical. You’re comfortable with open-source languages and are passionate about developing further. You have hands-on experience developing data science solutions using open-source tools and cloud computing platforms.
   Statistically-minded. You’ve built models, validated them, and backtested them. You know how to interpret a confusion matrix or a ROC curve. You have experience with clustering, classification, time series, and deep learning.
   Innovative. You continually research and evaluate emerging technologies. You stay current on published state-of-the-art methods, technologies, and applications and seek out opportunities to apply them.

           About athenahealth
         
         
         
           Here’s our vision: To create a thriving ecosystem that delivers accessible, high-quality, and sustainable healthcare for all.
         
         
         
           What’s unique about our locations?
           From an historic, 19th century arsenal to a converted, landmark power plant, all of athenahealth’s offices were carefully chosen to represent our innovative spirit and promote the most positive and productive work environment for our teams. Our 10 offices across the United States and India — plus numerous remote employees — all work to modernize the healthcare experience, together.
           
           Our company culture might be our best feature.
           We don't take ourselves too seriously. But our work? That’s another story. athenahealth develops and implements products and services that support US healthcare: It’s our chance to create healthier futures for ourselves, for our family and friends, for everyone.
         
        
        
        
         
           Our vibrant and talented employees — or athenistas, as we call ourselves — spark the innovation and passion needed to accomplish our goal. We continue to expand our workforce with amazing people who bring diverse backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives at every level, and foster an environment where every athenista feels comfortable bringing their best selves to work.
         
        
        
        
         
           Our size makes a difference, too: We are small enough that your individual contributions will stand out — but large enough to grow your career with our resources and established business stability.
           
           Giving back is integral to our culture. Our athenaGives platform strives to support food security, expand access to high-quality healthcare for all, and support STEM education to develop providers and technologists who will provide access to high-quality healthcare for all in the future. As part of the evolution of athenahealth’s Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) program, we’ve selected nonprofit partners that align with our purpose and let us foster long-term partnerships for charitable giving, employee volunteerism, insight sharing, collaboration, and cross-team engagement.
         
        
        
        
         
           What can we do for you?
           Along with health and financial benefits, athenistas enjoy perks specific to each location, including commuter support, employee assistance programs, tuition assistance, employee resource groups, and collaborative workspaces — some offices even welcome dogs.
         
        
        
        
         
           In addition to our traditional benefits and perks, we sponsor events throughout the year, including book clubs, external speakers, and hackathons. And we provide athenistas with a company culture based on learning, the support of an engaged team, and an inclusive environment where all employees are valued.
         
        
        
        
         
           We also encourage a better work-life balance for athenistas with our flexibility. While we know in-office collaboration is critical to our vision, we recognize that not all work needs to be done within an office environment, full-time. With consistent communication and digital collaboration tools, athenahealth enables employees to find a balance that feels fulfilling and productive for each individual situation.

  About Netskope 
   Today, there's more data and users outside the enterprise than inside, causing the network perimeter as we know it to dissolve. We realized a new perimeter was needed, one that is built in the cloud and follows and protects data wherever it goes, so we started Netskope to redefine Cloud, Network and Data Security. 
   
   Since 2012, we have built the market-leading cloud security company and an award-winning culture powered by hundreds of employees spread across offices in Santa Clara, St. Louis, Bangalore, London, Melbourne, and Tokyo. Our core values are openness, honesty, and transparency, and we purposely developed our open desk layouts and large meeting spaces to support and promote partnerships, collaboration, and teamwork. From catered lunches and office celebrations to employee recognition events (pre and hopefully post-Covid) and social professional groups such as the Awesome Women of Netskope (AWON), we strive to keep work fun, supportive and interactive.
