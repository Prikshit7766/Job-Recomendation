    About Sensibull
    
  
   
    Retail investors have always lost in options trading. Most of us have just gone bust and given money to the big players.
     The reason? Irrational decisions, huge bets, stupid gambles. Emotions, impulsiveness, and urge to get rich quickly - or simply, the lack of discipline.
     What’s the good news? It is difficult to predict the future of stocks. But it is easy to get disciplined, and make informed decisions.
