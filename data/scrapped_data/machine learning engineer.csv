   Why Cisco?
 
 
   #WeAreCisco,
 
 
   where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it. We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box! But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.) Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward. So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!

 About Nautilus
  
  Nautilus is building artificial intelligence to advance the efficiency of ocean commerce. We deliver technology to help shipping companies minimize fuel consumption, maximize operational efficiency, and optimize fleet performance. By arming ship owners and operators with real-time predictive decision support, Nautilus is reducing greenhouse gas emissions and making global trade sustainable. 
  Ocean shipping consumes over $100 billion dollars of fuel every year, and up to 30% of it can be saved. For owner-operators, reliance on manually collected and analyzed data makes it difficult to optimize fleet performance in real-time. By providing a unified data platform that leverages machine learning, Nautilus helps its clients make better decisions to maximize the return on each ship and every voyage. For our clients, this means they drive closer collaboration, greater transparency, and stronger accountability across their global teams every day.

You’ll be working alongside data science engineers with extensive experience building machine learning models for ship performance based on these different data sets, and will have the opportunity to incorporate new and innovative ideas to assess and improve this performance. You will also be discussing on a daily basis with forward-thinking clients the performance of their fleet and how they can improve it. It’s an opportunity to bring new methodologies into the industry and have a meaningful impact on emissions globally.

"Builder.ai - What would you Build?",,"
 About us
  Innovation is fuelled by the power of possibilities. A few years ago, it was virtually impossible to innovate because building software needed a degree, it was simply too expensive, too complex, too risky and ultimately too inefficient. That’s why only 16% of projects were ever done on budget and 78% failed.
  We're changing that. We’re flipping software development on its head and kicking out the notion that you need to be an expert or do boot camps to learn how to make your app. Builder.ai’s platform lets you order the perfect software app for whatever problem you’re trying to solve. Our AI powered assembly line brings together Lego-like reusable features and experts from around the world to bring world-class ideas to life – ANYONE’s world-class ideas.
  Building software needs to be like ordering pizza – pick what you want, get recommendations for the features you need and simply wait till it's cooked and ready for you.
  Our human-assisted AI platform helps anyone build, run & scale tailor-made software. Everyone from the bakery in Riyadh and nursery in London, to large fortune 100 companies like the BBC or Pepsi.
  Life at Builder
  It’s a place where everything moves at lightning pace and most definitely not for the faint hearted. We celebrate diversity, push everyone to do more with less and yet provide a culture that allows everyone to experiment, push boundaries and learn by doing. Every Builder runs to our core value system of HEARTT (Heart, Entrepreneurship, Accountability, Respect, Trust & Transparency) and we’re always looking for team players, with a point of view, a sense of humility and a let’s-get-stuff-done attitude.
  Our scale up is at the intersection of a quirky startup where designers and machine learning specialists work on problems together to savvy commercial teams working with finance folks to invent new business models. #WhatWouldYouBuildWe are looking for a technical leader to help us achieve and maintain maximum potential in areas of rapid software delivery, automation, security, and quality.

No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

  Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break, and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

   We Are Cisco
 
 
   #WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.
 
 
   We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!
 
 
   But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
 
 
   Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.
 
 
   So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool.

   One in two people experience debilitating back, neck, shoulder, or joint pain — but traditional treatments have failed to meet their needs.

"Builder.ai - What would you Build?",,"
 About us
  Innovation is fuelled by the power of possibilities. A few years ago, it was virtually impossible to innovate because building software needed a degree, it was simply too expensive, too complex, too risky and ultimately too inefficient. That’s why only 16% of projects were ever done on budget and 78% failed.
  We're changing that. We’re flipping software development on its head and kicking out the notion that you need to be an expert or do boot camps to learn how to make your app. Builder.ai’s platform lets you order the perfect software app for whatever problem you’re trying to solve. Our AI powered assembly line brings together Lego-like reusable features and experts from around the world to bring world-class ideas to life – ANYONE’s world-class ideas.
 
  Building software needs to be like ordering pizza – pick what you want, get recommendations for the features you need and simply wait till it's cooked and ready for you.
  Our human-assisted AI platform helps anyone build, run & scale tailor-made software. Everyone from the bakery in Riyadh and nursery in London, to large fortune 100 companies like the BBC or Pepsi.
 
  Life at Builder
  It’s a place where everything moves at lightning pace and most definitely not for the faint-hearted. We celebrate diversity, push everyone to do more with less, and yet provide a culture that allows everyone to experiment, push boundaries and learn by doing. Every Builder runs to our core value system of HEART (Heart, Entrepreneurship, Accountability, Respect, Trust & Transparency) and we’re always looking for team players, with a point of view, a sense of humility and a let’s-get-stuff-done attitude.
  Our scale-up is at the intersection of a quirky startup where designers and machine learning specialists work on problems together to savvy commercial teams working with finance folks to invent new business models. #WhatWouldYouBuild
 
  Description 
 We are looking for a Full Stack Developer to produce scalable software solutions. You’ll be part of a cross-functional team that’s responsible for the full software development life cycle, from conception to deployment.

  If you’re also familiar with Agile methodologies, we’d like to meet you.
 
  Why You Should Join
  It is a challenging and diverse role that requires you to improve the existing developer platform, with a constant focus on making the experience better and more feature-packed. While trying to find solutions to problems, which are often overlooked or just too complicated for people to think about solving. Join this role if you are someone who doesn't shy away from creating a path in uncharted territory and is comfortable with trying, failing, and course-correcting fast.

  What you’ll do:
  Role & responsibilities
 
   Reporting to Director of Engineering and Sustainability, Corporate Affairs, this position will ideally be filled by a seasoned technical leader/architect with engineering/computer science background and 10+ years of experience in building education platforms and cloud-based solutions with big data, analytics, and machine learning.
   The focus of this role is to architect our next generation learning platform based on the Total Learning Architecture (edtech architectural blueprint) for the evolution and expansion of Cisco’s NetAcad portfolio. The purpose of this role is to spearhead the architecture of our new B2C- and mobile-first learning platform that will evolve to support B2B and B2B2C use cases, leveraging TLA as a blueprint for the architecture.

  We Are Cisco
 
   #WeAreCisco, where each person is outstanding, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all.
   We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!
   But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
   Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, aggressive steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.
   So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Social media trends enthusiast? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!

 Who We Are: 
  Stylumia believes in augmenting human intelligence in fashion and lifestyle retail for a better world. With relevant data and the right technology, people and businesses in fashion and lifestyle retail can solve challenging problems and change the world for the better. In 2015-16, when we looked at the available technology and solutions, we saw fashion forecasting and demand planning are either subjective in nature. We saw these methods do not solve the fundamental challenge in fashion trend spotting, trend forecast, and the business metrics of full-price sell-through continue to remain around the 50% mark creating over USD 750 billion/annum of wastage globally. The biggest wastage in the fashion industry is the one caused by ill-informed decision-making. 
  We saw a need for a different kind of technology and approach, and we knew it would need a different kind of company to build it. That is why we formed Stylumia, a Deep Tech company solving fundamental retail challenges. Stylumia is a global innovation-first Retail AI organisation. We have products that impact the daily lives of varying multi-disciplinary personas across the value chain as we strive to help them eliminate wastage in the industry, by augmenting their decisions with consumer-backed insights.
