Greetings from Panobiz business Technologies !!
Panobiz Business Technologies Pvt Ltd is focused on offering multiple services in the field of talent hiring & team building for SMEs & Large Corporates. Looking for good The Recruiting Process.,
The Recruiting Process;
The process of recruiting is a creative one, as it involves using both traditional and non-traditional resources and a network of established contacts to identify and attract talent. Resources often include community networking events, job fairs, online sources, career fairs, and advertising/marketing programs.
Recruiting may also involve headhunting, a term used to describe finding candidates who are currently employed and convincing them to change employers. The process of headhunting is usually reserved for recruiters seeking to fill professional and executive-level positions.
However, a recruiter’s role does not end with the discovery of potential candidates. In fact, these HR professionals must then engage in a number of subsequent activities:

 Candidate Screening: Recruiters are responsible for screening resumes to determine which candidates meet the minimum requirements. Recruiters then move chosen candidates on to the next step in the hiring process.
 Interviewing: In some organizations, recruiters are responsible for conducting initial interviews, which are then used to narrow the number of potential candidates who will be interviewed by the hiring manager. Often times, recruiters will set up interview appointments between the chosen candidates and the hiring manager.
 Reference and Background Checks: After interviews have taken place and the hiring manager expresses an interest to hire a candidate, the recruiter is often called upon to coordinate the reference and background checks. Recruiters are often responsible for conducting reference checks by verifying employment information and contacting the professional and personal contacts provided by the candidate.

Daily Job Duties of HR Recruiting Specialists;

 Partnering with hiring managers to determine staffing needs
 Screening resumes
 Performing in-person and phone interviews with candidates
 Administering appropriate company assessments
